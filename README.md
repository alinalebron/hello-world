===========

experimentation with my first repository!

Hey there! My name is Alina Lebron and I'm in love with programming. One thing they don't teach you in school is establishing an online presence in the programming world. GitHub is where it's at, so I'm finally on here! I'm totally excited. So stay tuned for the projects I'll be working on. This should be great.
